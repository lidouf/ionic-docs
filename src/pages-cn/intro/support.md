# Support


## Support Policy

### Long Term Support

With Long Term Support (LTS), we plan to provide developers and organizations with stability and reliability in the apps they’re developing. For <a href="/docs/intro/versioning#major-release" target="_blank">major releases</a>, such as Ionic Framework 4.0.0, bug fixes are provided for 2 years and security fixes, although rare, are provided for 3 years. This means that when v5.0.0 is released, for two years past the release we’ll continue to fix bugs within the latest 4.x.x release.

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no LTS for framework versions below 4.0.</p>
</blockquote>

## Paid Support Options

Ionic offers paid support options for teams and organizations that would like guaranteed support level agreements (SLAs) and advisory services to help them kick off or maintain their Ionic projects. You can learn more about our Enterprise Support packages <a href="https://ionicframework.com/enterprise/support" target="_blank">here</a>.
